Perfect! Let's start **Day 5** of your CSS journey 👇

### ✅ **Day 5 – Advanced CSS Grid (Auto-Fit, `minmax()`, Grid Areas)**

Today’s focus is on building **complex layouts** with more **control and responsiveness** using advanced Grid techniques.

---

### 📘 **Concepts You Learned Today**

#### 🔹 `auto-fit` and `auto-fill`

* Automatically fills the row with as many columns as fit.
* Example:

  ```css
  grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(200px, 1fr));
  ```

#### 🔹 `minmax(min, max)`

* Sets a range for column width.
* Useful for responsive cards that don’t get too small or too big.

#### 🔹 `grid-template-areas`

* Assigns names to different parts of the layout.
* Example:

  ```css
  grid-template-areas:
    "header header"
    "sidebar main";
  ```

#### 🔹 Nested Grids

* Grid within a grid (like a card inside a card section).

---

### 🧠 **New Things You Practiced**

* Building a layout using `auto-fit` + `minmax()` for responsiveness.
* Using `grid-area` and `grid-template-areas` for readable, structured layout.
* Nesting grids for structured card design.

---

### 💻 **Mini Project Idea (Day 5)**

**"Responsive Dashboard Layout"**

Build a **dashboard UI** with:

* A sidebar (fixed width),
* A header (full-width),
* A main content area (with cards using `auto-fit`),
* Use `grid-template-areas` for layout,
* Add hover effect to cards with smooth transitions.

---

### ✍️ **Sample Grid Code (Summary)**

```css
.container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-areas:
    "header header"
    "sidebar main";
  grid-template-columns: 200px 1fr;
  grid-template-rows: auto 1fr;
  height: 100vh;
}
.header {
  grid-area: header;
}
.sidebar {
  grid-area: sidebar;
}
.main {
  grid-area: main;
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(250px, 1fr));
  gap: 20px;
}
```

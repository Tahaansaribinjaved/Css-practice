Perfect, Taha! Here's your **Day 3 task breakdown** (structure only — **no code**, you’ll write it yourself 💪):

---

## ✅ **Day 3 – Responsive Multi-Card Layout (Grid + Reusability)**

### 🎯 Objective:

Create a **responsive layout of 3–4 profile cards** using **CSS Grid** with hover interactions and reusable classes.

---

### 🧩 **Include the Following in Your Task:**

#### 1. **Page Layout:**

* A container that holds all cards
* Use `display: grid` to layout the cards
* Use `gap` to space them evenly

#### 2. **Cards (3–4):**

Each card should include:

* Profile image (can use the same placeholder)
* Name (e.g. John Doe)
* Role or title (e.g. Frontend Developer)
* Follower/Following section (optional but better)
* Buttons: **Follow** and **Message**

#### 3. **Reusability (Important):**

* Use a `.card` class and apply same style to all cards
* Use common classes for buttons (like `.btn`, `.btn-primary`, `.btn-outline`)
* Use a `.details` or `.info` class to hold inner data

#### 4. **Responsiveness:**

* On large screens: 3–4 cards in one row
* On medium/tablet: 2 cards per row
* On small/mobile: 1 card per row
* Use `grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(...))`

#### 5. **Hover Effects:**

* Slight scale or shadow on hover for each card
* Button hover animations (like color or scale)

#### 6. **Font & Colors:**

* Use Google Fonts (Poppins or similar)
* Soft, consistent color palette (light purple, dark blue, etc.)

#### 7. **Finishing Touches:**

* Rounded corners
* Box shadows
* Margin/padding balanced

---

### 📝 Bonus Challenge (Optional):

* Add `transition` effects for smoother animation
* Create a reusable class file if you're separating CSS
